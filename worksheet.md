# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
    * They're both git version control sites. both work well, neither is likely better than the other
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
    * Matthew Roberts made the last commit on the 18th of August 2022
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
    * Jon Mountjoy made the first commit on the 11th of August 2014
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
    * The latest commit was by Dave Pearce on the 11th August 2022
    * The first commit was by Dave Pearce in June 2010
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
    * neither project has been touched since 2022, they must have no reason (or no urgent reason) to be changed. Maybe they are complete.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
    * src/main/java/wyil/lang/WyilFile.java    has the most changes at 7790 in WHiley Compiler
    * static/data/forces.csv  has the most changes at 23588 in master

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
